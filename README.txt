# 🗓 I-SCHED: Automated Job Scheduling System

**I-SCHED** is a Python-based desktop application developed using **Tkinter** that automates job scheduling using advanced algorithmic techniques such as the **Fractional Knapsack**, **Earliest Deadline First (EDF)**, and **Merge Sort** algorithms. Designed with usability and optimization in mind, the system intelligently arranges tasks based on deadlines, importance, and available time, helping users manage their schedules more efficiently.
